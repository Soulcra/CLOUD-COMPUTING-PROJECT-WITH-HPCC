# CLOUD-COMPUTING-PROJECT-WITH-HPCC
This HPCC project is strategically elaborated to utilize the power of ECL
(Enterprise Control Language) for complete processing and insightful analysis of
financial data retrieved from the 'accounts' dataset. The project follows a carefully
planned series of interconnected phases, it starts by employing data spraying
methods to manage CSV-formatted data, along with the creation of a strong record
set definition. Moreover, subsequent stages involve more procedures, including
detailed filtering and counting applied to the accounts dataset. These processes
incorporate different criteria, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of the financial
data landscape. The implementation introduces the use of Boolean definitions to
systematically evaluate the relations between attributes associated with invoices,
enhancing the depth and precision of the analysis. Finally, the project culminates
with the generation of a comprehensive report. This report serves as a detailed
oriented of the chosen methodology, step-by-step implementation procedures, and
the logical results achieved through the thorough analysis of financial data. The
project's approach makes sure not only the extraction of valuable insights but also
their logical meaning for informed decision-making in the financial area.
